Model 204 is a database management system for IBM and compatible mainframe computers, “born” 1965 October 13, and first deployed in 1972. It incorporates a programming language and an environment for application development. Implemented in assembly language for IBM System/360 and its successors, M204 can deal with very large databases and transaction loads of 1000 TPS.
Model 204 relies on its own type of bitmap index, originally devised by Professor Patrick E. O'Neil, and combines the use of hash table, B-tree, and record list technologies to optimize speed and efficiency of database access.
Although M204 is a pre-SQL (and pre-relational) database product, it is possible to manually map the files of an M204 database to approximate SQL equivalents and provide some limited SQL functionality using Model 204 SQL Server.
Model 204 is most commonly used in government and military applications. Among other things, it runs Australia's social security system (Centrelink). It is used commercially in the UK by Marks & Spencer.
