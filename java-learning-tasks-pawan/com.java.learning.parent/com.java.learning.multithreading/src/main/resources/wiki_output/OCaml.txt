OCaml ( oh-KAM-əl), originally named Objective Caml, is the main implementation of the programming language Caml, created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez and others in 1996. A member of the ML language family, OCaml extends the core Caml language with object-oriented programming constructs.
OCaml's toolset includes an interactive top-level interpreter, a bytecode compiler, an optimizing native code compiler, a reversible debugger, and a package manager (OPAM). It has a large standard library, making it useful for many of the same applications as Python or Perl, and has robust modular and object-oriented programming constructs that make it applicable for large-scale software engineering. OCaml is the successor to Caml Light. The acronym CAML originally stood for Categorical Abstract Machine Language, although OCaml omits this abstract machine.
OCaml is a free and open-source software project managed and principally maintained by French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA).
