The Sarsılmaz Kılınç 2000 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum round. It is manufactured at the Sarsılmaz Silah Sanayi factory in Turkey, sold in the U.S. by the ArmaLite corporation under the ArmaLite name as the AR-24.
The weapon is similar to the Tanfoglio variant of the Czech CZ-75, with design elements borrowed from the SIG P210, though few of its parts are interchangeable with the Tanfoglio weapon from whose machining dies and blue prints it was derived.
