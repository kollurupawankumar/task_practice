Clojure ( , like "closure") is a dialect of the Lisp programming language. Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java virtual machine and the Common Language Runtime. There is a dialect, developed in lockstep with Clojure, called ClojureScript, that compiles to ECMAScript 3. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system.
