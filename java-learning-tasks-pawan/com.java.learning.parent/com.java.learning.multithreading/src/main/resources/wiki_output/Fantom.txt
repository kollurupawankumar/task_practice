Fantom is a Swedish velomobile with four wheels, two in the front and two in the rear. It has no front suspension, but has suspension in the rear.
Fantom was never sold as a finished product. Instead it was sold as a set of drawings. The drawings are not exact and should be used as a guide. Hobbex bought the rights to the drawings and have sold it continuously since the 1940s apart from a short break in the 1990s.
