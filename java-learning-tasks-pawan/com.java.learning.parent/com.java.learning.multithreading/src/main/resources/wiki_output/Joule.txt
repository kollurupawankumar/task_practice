The joule (); (symbol: J), is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).
In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units:

where kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt.
One joule can also be defined as:
The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one "coulomb-volt" (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one "watt-second" (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour –  3.6 megajoules).
