Component Pascal is a programming language in the tradition of Niklaus Wirth's Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon and Oberon-2. It bears the name of the Pascal programming language and it preserves its heritage, but it is not compatible with Pascal. Instead, it is a minor variant and refinement of Oberon-2 with a more expressive type system and built-in string support. Component Pascal was originally designed and supported by a small ETH ZÃ¼rich spin-off company called Oberon microsystems under the name Oberon/L. They developed an IDE (Integrated development environment) called BlackBox Component Builder. Since 2014 development and support has been taken over by a small group of volunteers.
