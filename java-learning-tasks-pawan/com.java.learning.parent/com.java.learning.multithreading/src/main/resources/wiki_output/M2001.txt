M2001 is a modular educational mathematical programming language for developing and presenting mathematical algorithms, from the modern discrete to the classical continuous mathematics. M2001 is built on a semantic framework that is based in category theory and has a syntax similar to that of Pascal or Modula-2.
It is designed purely for pedagogic use, so efficiency and ease of implementation have been far less important in its development than generality and range of application.
