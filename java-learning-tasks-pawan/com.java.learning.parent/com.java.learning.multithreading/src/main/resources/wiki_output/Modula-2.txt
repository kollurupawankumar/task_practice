Modula-2 is a computer programming language designed and developed between 1977 and 1985 by Niklaus Wirth at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) as a revision of Pascal to serve as the sole programming language for the operating system and application software for the personal workstation Lilith. The principal concepts were:
The module as a compilation unit for separate compilation
The coroutine as the basic building block for concurrent processes
Types and procedures that allow access to machine-specific data.
Modula-2 was viewed by Niklaus Wirth as a successor to his earlier programming languages Pascal and Modula.
