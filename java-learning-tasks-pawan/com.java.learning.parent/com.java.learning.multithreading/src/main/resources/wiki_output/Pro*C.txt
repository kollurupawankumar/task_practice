Pro*C (also known as Pro*C/C++) is an embedded SQL programming language used by Oracle Database database management systems. Pro*C uses either C or C++ as its host language. During compilation, the embedded SQL statements are interpreted by a precompiler and replaced by C or C++ function calls to their respective SQL library.
