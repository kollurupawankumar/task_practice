Perl 6 is a member of the Perl family of programming languages.
While historically several interpreter and compiler implementations were being written, today only the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation is in active development.
It is introducing elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl 5 is not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Perl 6 began in 2000. In February 2015 a post on The Perl Foundation blog stated that "The Perl6 team will attempt to get a development release of version 1.0 available for Larry's birthday in September and a Version 1.0 release by Christmas", and on December 25, 2015, the first stable version of the specification was announced.
Development on Pugs, the first high-traction implementation, began in 2005, and there have been multiple Perl 6 implementation projects. Rakudo Perl 6 is based on NQP (Not Quite Perl) and can use MoarVM or the Java Virtual Machine as a runtime environment, and releases a new version every month; in July 2010, the project released the first Rakudo Star distribution, a useful and usable collection of a Perl 6 implementation and related materials.
