BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language"; or 'Before C Programming Language' (a common humorous backronym) ) is a procedural, imperative, and structured computer programming language. Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based.
