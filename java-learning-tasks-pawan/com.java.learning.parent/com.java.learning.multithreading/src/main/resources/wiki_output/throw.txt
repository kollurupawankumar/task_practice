Throwing is the launching of a ballistic projectile by hand. This action is only possible for animals with the ability to grasp objects with their hands (mainly primates).
Humans, being bipedal, have a wide variety of throwing techniques and abilities. These have been employed in warfare â€“ first through rock-throwing, then refined weapon-throwing (e.g. spear, throwing axe), and into modern day with hand grenades and tear gas canisters. Throwing is used in many sports and games, particularly ball games, and in throwing sports the action is the main determiner of the outcome.
