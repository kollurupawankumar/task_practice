POP-11 is a reflective, incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language. It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham which hosts the Poplog website.
POP-11 is an evolution of the language POP-2, developed in Edinburgh University and features an open stack model (like Forth, among others). It is mainly procedural, but supports declarative language constructs, including a pattern matcher and is mostly used for research and teaching in Artificial Intelligence, although it has features sufficient for many other classes of problems. It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11's features is that it supports first-class functions.
Pop-11 is the core language of the Poplog system.
