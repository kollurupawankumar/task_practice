Lego Mindstorms is a hardware software platform produced by Lego for the development of programmable robots based on Lego building blocks. Each version of the system includes an intelligent brick computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and Lego parts from the Technic line to create the mechanical systems.
Since creation, there have been four generations of the Mindstorms platform: the original Robotics Invention System, NXT, NXT 2.0, and EV3. With each platform release, the motor and sensor capabilities expanded. The latest system, Lego Mindstorms EV3, was released on September 1, 2013.
