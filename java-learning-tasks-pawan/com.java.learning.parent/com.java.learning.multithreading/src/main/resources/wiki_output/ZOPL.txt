ZOPL is a programming language created by Geac Computer Corporation in the early 1970s for use on their mainframe computer systems used in libraries and banking institutions. It had similarities to C and Pascal.
ZOPL stood for "Version Z, Our Programming Language".
ZOPL is still in use at CGI Group (formerly known as RealTime Datapro), who ported it to VAX/VMS and Unix in the 1980s, and to Windows in 1998. It currently (2010) runs on Windows XP/2000/2003 and Red Hat Linux.
