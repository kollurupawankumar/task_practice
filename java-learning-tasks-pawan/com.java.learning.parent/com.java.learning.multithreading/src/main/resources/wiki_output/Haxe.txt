Haxe is a high-level cross-platform multi-paradigm programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code, for many different computing platforms, from one code-base. It is free and open-source software, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0, and the standard library under an MIT License.
Haxe includes a set of common functions that are supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types, text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific application programming interface (API) for Adobe Flash, C++, PHP and other languages. OpenFL, Kha and Flambe are popular Haxe frameworks that enable creating multi-platform content from one codebase.
Haxe originated with the idea of supporting client-side and server-side programming in one language, and simplifying the communication logic between them. Code written in the Haxe language can be source-to-source compiled into ActionScript 3, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, PHP, Python, Lua and Node.js.
