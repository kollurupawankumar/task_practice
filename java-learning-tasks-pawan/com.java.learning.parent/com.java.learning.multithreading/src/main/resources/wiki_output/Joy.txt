The word joy means a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.
C. S. Lewis saw clear distinction between joy and pleasure and happiness; "I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy.", and "I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is."
The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources.
