The Wolfram Language is a general multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research and is the programming language of the mathematical symbolic computation program Mathematica and the Wolfram Programming Cloud. It emphasizes symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming and can employ arbitrary structures and data.
It includes built-in functions for generating and running Turing machines, creating graphics and audio, analyzing 3D models, matrix manipulations, and solving differential equations. It is extensively documented.
The Wolfram language was released for the Raspberry Pi in 2013 with the goal of making it free for all Raspberry Pi users. It was controversially included in the recommended software bundle that the Raspberry Pi Foundation provides for beginners. Plans to port the Wolfram language to the Intel Edison were announced after the board's introduction at CES 2014.
