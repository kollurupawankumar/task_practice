RuneScape is a fantasy MMORPG developed and published by Jagex, released originally in January 2001. RuneScape can be used as a graphical browser game, implemented on the client-side in Java, and incorporates 3D rendering. Since the release of the NXT client in April 2016, a non-browser based version of the game that is written in C++ is also available. The game has had over 200Â million accounts created and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world's largest free MMORPG and the most-updated game.
RuneScape takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. Players can travel throughout Gielinor via a number of methods including on foot, magical spells, or charter ships.
